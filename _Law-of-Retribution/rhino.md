# Law of Retribution - Rhino

![Rhino](http://i.imgur.com/1s1uRb1.jpg)

When it comes to hard crowd control, Rhino is arguably the best choice for raids. Not only can he CC large areas in a second, but he can also buff allies when killing is needed. His ability to tank high amounts of damage make him  a good pick for inexperienced players.

## Role: CC

## Build notes
* High range allows stomp to affect a large area. 
* High efficiency allows you to constantly recast stomp to affect newly spawned enemies or enemies you did not catch before.
* Having some amount of strength helps you to stay alive with the use of Iron Skin.
* Natural talent is used to ensure you spend as little time as possible casting.
* A movement mod is used because going fast is always better than going slow.

## Tactics

* Make sure to recast Stomp whenever you have energy.
* Be careful of stomping off pads in stages 2 and 3, as it could significantly slow down the raid if that happens.
* Use your Iron Skin to keep yourself alive.
* Use Rhino Charge to move around the map quickly.
