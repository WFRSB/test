# Law of Retribution - Banshee

Although Banshee does not have a lot of uses in The Law of Retribution, she can still provide some important services such as allowing the team to instantly kill Vey Hek and carry bombs with her high power pool.

## Role: Bomb Carrier, Damage Amp

## Build notes

* There can be a lot of versatility with Banshee builds for LoR
* The build needs to fulfill core requirements of 100+% power strength, cast speed, and high power pool
* The mods that are needed are as listed
* Natural Talent
* Quick Thinking
* Primed Flow (or regular if you don't have primed)
* Intensify/Blind Rage/Transient Fortitude (choose 1 or 2 based of the other 5 mods you choose.)
* Aura Mod (Preferably Corrosive Projection or Enemy Radar)
* For the other 5 mods you can choose based on how you like to play.
* Make sure Sonar lasts at least 5 seconds and has at least 15m range.
* Keep the core requirements in mind when making your build if you choose to make your own

## Tactics

* Soundquake is great hard CC, however you can easily kill enemies with this (especially if you are using RQ).
* Use this skill ONLY in emergencies on the hijack part of LoR.
* Your main job comes at the very end of the raid as your team is destroying the last tower.
* During this part, position yourself within sonar range of Vay Hek and spam sonar.
* Sonar only applies after Vay Hek becomes vulnerable
* If your team is shooting the bomb to destroy towers, spam sonar when the bomb is 70%-80% charge
* If your team lets the bomb decay to destroy towers, spam sonar when the bomb has around 40%-50% of its charge left.
* Sonar stacks multiplicatively.
* Vay Hek should die as he touches the ground if you did everything right.

## Side-Notes 

* Due to the fact that Banshee really only needs 5 mods to be raid ready so I recommend getting her if you don't have an extensive mod collection.
