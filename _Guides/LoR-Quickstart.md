# Law of Retribution Quickstart guide

LoR can be a very frustrating and confusing experience at first especially if you are trying to learn it by yourself.  Here are some pointers to make it as easy as possible to get started.

* * *

1. Equip a raid-viable frame!
- Take a look over at the [builds]({{site.baseurl}}/Builds/Law-of-Retribution/).
- If you can equip a Corrosive Projection it is recommended that you do so.
1. Build some Large Team Energy Restores
- Some parts of the raid take a lot of energy to beat, and sometimes your EV simply can’t keep up with you! Especially if there’s no enemies around. Building and using energy restores is highly recommended for this reason. If you don't have access to those, smaller size restores will be fine in the mean time.
  - Pro tip: bind your restores to a hotkey for ease of use!
1. Join a Law of Retribution bus on RSB.
- Join the server.
- Add the LFBus Role and begin looking for a bus.

## Inside the Raid

- Keep the mobs alive!
- Mobs in LoR are better left alive and CC’d than dead! If you kill everything, your trinity will have nothing to EV, and you will simply spawn more mobs that aren’t CC’d.
  - This rule has exceptions. Always kill any mob with knock-back capability in phase 2! This includes: Scorpions, Powerfists, Shield Lancers (including Shik Tal, the G3 member), Arson eximus, Heavy Gunners and Bombards when they get too close.
